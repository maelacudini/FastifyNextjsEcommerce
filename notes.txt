[] not too happy about the placement of this file apps\api\src\plugins\jwtPlugin.ts, the folder Plugin gets a little lost between all 
  entities folders inside apps\api\src

[] where should i put apps\api\src\auth\application\bcrypt-password-hasher.usecase.ts and apps\api\src\auth\domain\password-hasher.port.ts?

[] should i keep the use of bcrypt separate? i'm thinking: if a thing can change independently,
  it gets an interface. Hashing algorithms change, libraries change, security requirements change.
  is this correct?

[x] is it correct to keep password in auth and separate from the user entity? did i include the correct methods in
  apps/api/src/auth/adapters/outbound/auth.repository.postgres.ts?

[x] will i have two different tables in my database for auth and user entities? is it the correct setup?

[x] where should i place apps\api\src\application\create-user-with-auth.usecase.ts? based on the logic used in this
  project up to now, when i create a user i should use both user and auth entity: is this correct?
  where can i place the logic and how do i divide it while keeping a clear hexagonal architecture pattern?

[x] how do i setup docker compose secrets?
